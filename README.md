# Wasted

Plugin for setting custom death messages. \
The plugin supports work with mods. \
The plugin takes into account the in-game rule of showing death messages.

All messages are stored in localization files -> `{CONFIG_DIR}/localeapi/wasted/*`.
Initially, the plugin does not contain death messages. They will be added to the localization by default with each new unique player death.
If you'd like, you can provide me with a default localization file filled with all the vanilla death messages and I'll add it to the next release.



##### Commands: 
/sponge plugins refresh wasted - Reload plugin config. \
